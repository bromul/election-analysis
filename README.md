## Overview of Election Audit
This project analyzed voter data to certify the results of a U.S. congressional election in a Colorado precinct.

## Purpose
We had been asked by Tom, a Board of Elections official, and his manager Seth, to create a code that could quickly count through the voter data in their congressional election and certify the results for the election commission. 
Once this had been determined, we modified our code to further assist with the electoral audit - specifically by determining the county with the largest turnout.

Total number of votes cast, how many votes each candidate received (gross and percentage), and the winner of the election. Later we were asked to see how many votes (gross and percentage) were cast in separate counties.
To certify the election.
